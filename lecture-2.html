# Chapter 1 Introduction

**Homework:** Read Chapter 1 (Introduction)

#### Levels of abstraction (virtual machines)

Software is often implemented in layers (so is hardware, but that is not the
subject of this course). The higher layers use the facilities provided by
lower layers.

Alternatively said, the upper layers are written using a more powerful and
more abstract virtual machine than the lower layers.

In yet other words, each layer is written as though it runs on the virtual
machine supplied by the lower layers and in turn provides a more abstract
(pleasant) virtual machine for the higher layers to run on.

Using a broad brush, the layers are.

---
  1. Applications (e.g., web browser) and utilities (e.g., compiler, linker).
  2. User interface (UI). It may be text oriented (Unix/Linux shell, DOS prompt) or graphical (GUI, e.g., MS Windows, Gnome/KDE, MAC).
  3. Libraries (e.g., libc).
  4. The OS proper (the kernel).
  5. Hardware.

An important distinction is that the kernel runs in
**privileged/kernel/supervisor** mode; whereas your programs, as well as
compilers, editors, shell, linkers, browsers, etc. run in **user** mode. This
means that the OS can access all the hardware and execute all possible
instructions.

In contrast user programs cannot directly modify the hardware; for example I/O
instructions are normally privileged. So the programs you and I write
**cannot** perform I/O; but they can ask the OS to perform the I/O for them.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

The kernel is itself normally layered, e.g.

  1. (Machine independent) files and filesystems.
  2. (Machine independent) I/O.
  3. (Machine dependent) device drivers.

The machine independent I/O layer is written assuming virtual (i.e. idealized)
hardware. For example, the machine independent I/O portion can access a
certain byte in a given file. In reality, I/O devices, e.g., disks, have no
support or knowledge of files; these devices support only blocks. Lower levels
of the software implement files in terms of blocks.

Often the machine independent part is itself more than one layer.

The term Operating System is not well defined. Is it just the kernel, i.e.,

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
the portion run in supervisor mode? How about the libraries? The utilities?
All these are certainly **system software** but it is not clear how much is
part of the OS.

## 1.1 What is an operating system?

As mentioned above, the OS raises the abstraction level by providing a higher
level virtual machine. A second related key objective for the OS is to manage
the resources provided by this virtual machine.

---
### 1.1.1 The Operating System as an Extended Machine

The kernel itself raises the level of abstraction and hides details. For
example a user (of the kernel) can write() to a file (a concept not present in
hardware) and without knowing whether the file resides on a solid-state-disk
(SSD), an internal scsi disk, or a local USB disk. The user can also ignore
issues such as whether the file is stored contiguously or is broken into
blocks.

Well designed abstractions are a key to managing complexity.

---
### 1.1.2 The Operating System as a Resource Manager

The kernel must manage the resources to resolve conflicts between users. Note
that when we say users, we are not referring directly to humans, but instead
to processes (typically) running on behalf of humans.

Often the resource is shared or _multiplexed_ between the users. This can take
the form of _time-multiplexing_, where the users take turns (e.g., the
processor resource) or _space-multiplexing_, where each user gets a part of
the resource (e.g., a disk drive).

With sharing comes various issues such as protection, privacy, fairness, etc.

#### How is an OS Fundamentally Different from (say) a Compiler?


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
Answer: Concurrency! Per Brinch Hansen in _Operating Systems Principles_
(Prentice Hall, 1973) writes.

> The main difficulty of multiprogramming is that concurrent activities can
interact in a time-dependent manner, which makes it practically impossibly to
locate programming errors by systematic testing. Perhaps, more than anything
else, this explains the difficulty of making operating systems reliable.

**Homework:** 1\. (Unless otherwise stated, problems numbers are from the end of the current chapter in Tanenbaum.) What are the two main functions of an operating system?

## 1.2 History of Operating Systems

The subsection headings describe the hardware as well as the OS; we are
naturally more interested in the latter. These two development paths are
related as the improving hardware enabled the more advanced OS features.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.2.1 The first Generation (1945-55): Vacuum Tubes (and No OS)

One user (program; perhaps several humans) at a time. Any operating-system-
like functionality that was needed was part of the user's program.

Although this time frame predates my own usage, computers without serious
operating systems existed during the second generation and were then available
to a wider (but still very select) audience.

I have fond memories of the Bendix G-15 (paper tape) and the IBM 1620 (cards;
typewriter; decimal). During the short time you had the machine, it was truly
a personal computer.

---
### 1.2.2 The Second Generation (1955-65): Transitors and Batch Systems

Many jobs were batched together, but the systems were still **uniprogrammed**,
a job once started was run to completion without interruption and then flushed
from the system.

A change from the previous generation is that the OS was not reloaded for each
job and hence needed to be protected from the user's execution. As mentioned
above, in the first generation, the beginning of a job contained the trivial
OS-like support features used.

The batches of user jobs were prepared offline (cards to magnetic tape) using
a separate computer (an IBM 1401 with a 1402 card reader/punch). The tape was

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
brought to the main computer (an IBM 7090/7094) where the output to be printed
was written on another tape. This tape went back to the service machine (1401)
and was printed (on a 1403).


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.2.3 The Third Generation (1965-1980): ICs and Multiprogramming

In my opinion Multiprogramming is the biggest change from the OS point of
view. It is with multiprogramming (many processes executing concurrently) that
we have the operating system fielding requests whose arrival order is non-
deterministic. At this point operating systems become notoriously hard to get
right due to the inability to test a significant percentage of the possible
interactions and the inability to reproduce bugs on request.

Since multiple jobs are in memory at the same jobs, one job's memory must be
protected from the other jobs.

#### The Purpose of Multiprogramming

The purpose of multiprogramming is to overlap CPU and I/O activity and thus

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
greatly improve CPU utilization. Recall that these computers, in particular
the processors, were very expensive.

#### Multiple Batch Streams

  * IBM OS/MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks). 
    * OS for IBM system 360.
    * The (real) memory is partitioned and a batch is assigned to a fixed partition.
    * The memory assigned to a partition does not change.
    * Jobs are queued for a specific partition. These jobs are **not** multiprogrammed: When a job is loaded into a partition, it stays there until completion, other jobs destined for that partition wait their turn.
    * Jobs residing in **separate** partitions **are** multiprogrammed. When a job residing in one partition starts a (slow) I/O, the CPU switches to executing a job in another partition.
    * Jobs were **spooled** from cards into the memory; similarly output was spooled from the memory to a printer.
    * More details are presented later, when we study memory management.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
  * IBM OS/MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) (then other names). 
    * Each job gets just the amount of memory it needs. That is, the partitioning of memory changes as jobs enter and leave.
    * MVT is a more efficient user of resources, but is more difficult to implement.
    * Later, when we study OS/MVT in more detail, we will see that, with varying size partitions, questions such as compaction, holes, and fragmentation arise.

#### Spooling

With multiprogramming, one job could be loading (from say cards), another job
could be printing, and a third computing. So when a card deck was submitted by
the user it could be read directly into an on-disk queue. Then when the system
is ready to run another job, it is already there. Similarly, jobs would print

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
to disk and later another task would really print these disk files onto paper.

#### Time Sharing

This is multiprogramming with rapid switching between jobs (processes) so
that, to the user it appears that their job is always running (but at a slower
rate). Also individual users spool their own printed output onto a remote
terminal. Deciding when to switch and which process to switch to is called
**scheduling**.

We will study scheduling when we cover processor management a few weeks from
now.

MIT and Dartmouth were pioneers in timesharing. Since I went to MIT, I
naturally believe MIT was first. In particular, during my second semester
(jan-may 1964), I took a course that by luck was chosen to the first one on

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
the MIT timesharing system CTSS. I do believe that I was in the first group of
undergraduates (about 15 or 20 students I guess) to use timesharing. Tanenbaum
also asserts that MIT was first, but again he was a student there (in
physics).

---
### 1.2.4 The Fourth Generation (1980-Present): Personal Computers

Serious PC Operating systems such as Unix/Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/etc
and (the newer versions of) MacOS are multiprogrammed.

GUIs have become important. What is not clear is whether the GUI should be
part of the kernel.

Early PC operating systems were uniprogrammed and their direct descendants
lasted for quite some time (e.g., Windows ME), but now all (non-embedded) OS
are multiprogrammed.

**Note**: I very much recommend reading all of 1.2, not for this course especially, but for general interest. Tanenbaum writes well and is my age so lived through much of the history himself.

**Homework:**


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
  * What is multiprogramming?
  * Why was timesharing not widespread on second generation computers?
  * What is spooling? Do you think that advanced personal computers will have spooling as a standard feature in the future?
  * 5\. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA). What implications does this have for multiprogramming?

Primarily hardware changes.

## 1.3 Computer Hardware Review

  
![system-dia](http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/diagrams/system-
dia.png)

The picture above is very simplified. (For one thing, today separate buses are
used to Memory and Video.)


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
A **bus** is a set of wires that connect two or more devices. Only one message
can be on the bus at a time. All the devices receive the message: There are no
switches in between to steer the message to the desired destination, but often
some of the wires form an address that indicates which devices should actually
process the message.

---
### 1.3.1 Processors

Only at a few points will we need to understand the various processor
registers such as the _program counter_ (a.k.a, _instruction pointer_), the
_stack pointer_, and the _Program Status Words (PSWs)_. We will ignore
computer design issues such as _pipelining_ and _superscalar_.

Many of these issues are mentioned in 201 and nearly all of them are covered
in 436, the computer architecture elective.

We do, however, need the notion of a **trap**, that is an instruction that
_atomically_ switches the processor into privileged mode and jumps to a pre-
defined physical address. This is the key for _system calls_ in which a user
program enters the operating system. We will have much more to say about traps
at the end of this chapter.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

#### Multithreaded and Multicore Chips

Many of the OS issues introduced by multi-processors of any flavor are also
found in a uni-processor, multi-programmed system. In particular, successfully
handling the concurrency offered by the second class of systems, goes a long
way toward preparing for the first class. The remaining multi-processor issues
are not covered in this course.

---
### 1.3.2 Memory

We will ignore caches (which are covered in 201 and especially 436; you can
see my online class notes for the latter, if you are interested), but we will
later discuss demand paging, which is very similar. Despite their similarity,
demand paging and caches use largely disjoint terminology. In both cases, the
goal is to combine large, slow memory with small, fast memory to achieve the
effect of large, fast memory.

The central memory in a system is called **RAM** (Random Access Memory). A key
point is that it is volatile, i.e. the memory loses its data if power is
turned off.

#### ROM / PROM / EPROM / EEPROM / Flash Ram

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

**ROM** (Read Only Memory) is used for (low-level control) software that often comes with devices on general purpose computers, and for the entire software system on non-user-programmable devices such as microwaves and dumb wristwatches. It is also used for non-changing data. A modern, familiar ROM is CD-ROM (or the denser DVD, or the even denser Blu-ray). ROM is non-volatile.

But often this unchangable data needs to be changed (e.g., to fix bugs). This
gives rise first to **PROM** (Programmable ROM), which, like a CD-R, can be
written once (as opposed to being mass produced already written like a CD-
ROM), and then to **EPROM** (Erasable PROM), which is like a CD-RW. Early
EPROMs needed UV light for erasure; **EEPROM**, Electrically EPROM or **Flash
RAM)** can be erased by normal circuitry, which is much more convenient.

#### Memory Protection and Context Switching


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
As mentioned above when discussing OS/MFT and OS/MVT, multiprogramming
requires that we protect one process from another. That is, we need to
translate the **virtual addresses** (a virtual address is the address as
written in the program) into **physical addresses** (a physical address is the
actual memory address in the computer) such that, at any point in time, the
physical address of each process are disjoint. The hardware that performs this
translation is called the **MMU** or **Memory Management Unit**. (There are
occasions when two processes wish to share memory.)

Note the similarity between (1) translating virtual to physical addresses by
the OS and (2) relocating relative addresses (into absolute addresses) in your
lab 1 linker.

When **context switching** from one process to another, the translation mus

t
change, which can be an expensive operation.

### 1.3.3 Disks

When we do I/O for real, I will show a real disk opened up and illustrate the
components

  * Platter
  * Surface
  * Head
  * Track
  * Sector
  * Cylinder
  * Seek time
  * Rotational latency
  * Transfer time

Devices are often quite difficult to manage and a separate computer, called a
controller, is used to translate OS commands into what the device requires.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

#### Solid State Disks (SSDs)

This is flash RAM organized in sector-like blocks as is a disk. Unlike RAM,
SSD is non volatile; unlike a disk it has no moving parts (and so is faster).
The blocks can be written a large number of times. However, the large number
is not large enough to be completely ignored.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.3.A Tapes

The bottom of the memory hierarchy, tapes have large capacities, tiny cost per
byte, and very long access times. Tapes are becoming less important since
their technology improvement has not kept up with the improvement in disks. We
will not study tapes in this course.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.3.4 I/O Devices

In addition to the disks and tapes just mentioned, I/O devices include
monitors (and graphics controllers), NICs (Network Interface Controllers),
Modems, Keyboards, Mice, etc.

The OS communicates with the device controller, not with the device itself.
For each different controller, a corresponding **device driver** is included
in the OS. Note that, for example, many graphics controllers are capable of
controlling a standard monitor, and hence the OS needs many graphics device
drivers.

In theory any SCSI (Small Computer System Interconnect) controller can control
any SCSI disk. In practice this is not true as SCSI gets inproved to wide
scsi, ultra scsi, etc. The newer controllers can still control the older di

---
sks
and often the newer disks can run in degraded mode with an older controller.

#### How Does the OS Know When the I/O Is Complete?

Three methods are employed.

  1. The OS can **busy wait**, constantly asking the controller if the I/O is complete. This is the easiest method, but can have low performance. It is also called **polling** or **PIO (Programmed I/O)**.
  2. The OS can tell the controller to start the I/O and then switch to other tasks. The controller must then **interrupt** the OS when the I/O is done. This method induces less waiting, but is harder to program (concurrency!). Moreover, on modern processors a single interrupt is rather costly, much more costly than a single memory reference, but much, much less costly than a disk I/O.
  3. Some controllers can do **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** in which case they deal directly with memory after being started by the CPU. A DMA controller relieves the CPU of some work and halves the number of bus accesses.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

We discuss these alternatives more in chapter 5. In particular, we explain the
last point about halving bus accesses.

### 1.3.6 Buses

On the right is a figure showing the specifications for an Intel chip set
introduced in 2000. The terminology used is not standardized, e.g., hubs are
often called bridges. Most likely due to their location on the diagram to the
right, the Memory Controller Hub is often called the Northbridge and the I/O
Controller Hub the Southbridge.

As shown on the right this chip set has two different width PCI buses. This
particular chip set supplies USB. An alternative is to have a PCI USB
controller.

Unlike the situation in the previous diagram with a single bus, now several
pairs of components can be communicating simultaneously, giving a significant

improvement in performance (and complexity).


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.3.7 Booting the Computer

When the power button is pressed, control starts at the BIOS, a PROM
(typically flash) in the system. Control is then passed to (the tiny program
stored in) the MBR (Master Boot Record), which is the first 512-byte block on
the primary disk. Control then proceeds to the first block in the active
partition and from there the OS is finally invoked (normally via an OS
loader).

The above assumes that the boot medium selected by the bios was the hard disk.
Other possibilities include a CD-ROM or the network.

## 1.4 OS Zoo

There is not much difference between mainframe, server, multiprocessor, and PC
OS's. Indeed the 3e considerably softened the differences given in the 2e and
this continues in the 4e. For example Unix/Linux and Windows runs on all of
them.

This course covers all four of those classes, which perhaps should be
considered just one class .

### 1.4.1 Mainframe Operating Systems

Used in data centers, these systems ofter tremendous I/O capabilities and
extensive fault tolerance.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.4.2 Server Operating Systems

Perhaps the most important servers today are web servers. Again I/O (and
network) performance are critical.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.4.3 Multiprocessor Operating systems

A multiprocessor (as opposed to a multi-computer or multiple computers or
computer network or grid) means multiple processors sharing memory and
controlled by a single instance of the OS, which typically can run on any of
the processors. Often it can run on several simultaneously.

Multiprocessors existed almost from the beginning of the computer age, but now
are not exotic. Indeed, even my current laptop is a multiprocessor.

#### Multiple computers

The operating system(s) controlling a system of multiple computers often are
classified as either a _Network OS_ or a _Distributed OS_. The former is
basically a collection of ordinary PCs on a LAN that use the network
facilities available on PC operating systems. Some extra utilities are often

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
present to ease running jobs on remote processors.

A _Distributed OS_ is a more sophisticated and seamless version of the above
where the boundaries between the processors are made nearly invisible to users
(except for performance).

This subject is not part of our course (but often is covered in 2251).


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.4.4 PC Operating Systems

In the recent past some OS systems (e.g., ME) were claimed to be _tailored_ to
client operation. Others felt that they were _restricted_ to client operation.
This seems to be gone now; a modern PC OS is fully functional. I guess for
marketing reasons some of the functionality can be disabled.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.4.5 Handheld Computer Operating Systems

This includes phones.

The only real difference between this class and the above is the restriction
to very modest memory and very low power. However, the very modest memory
keeps getting bigger and some phones now include a stripped-down linux.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.4.6 Embedded Operating Systems

The OS is part of the device, e.g., microwave ovens, and cardiac monitors. The
OS is on a ROM so is not changed.

Since no user code is run, protection is not as important. In that respect the
OS is similar to the very earliest computers. Embedded OS are very important
commercially, but not covered much in this course.

### 1.4.7 Sensor Node Operating Systems

These are embedded systems that also contain sensors and communication devices
so that the systems in an area can cooperate.

### 1.4.8 Real-time Operating Systems

As the name suggests, time (more accurately timeliness) is an important
consideration. There are two classes: soft vs hard real time. In the latter,
missing a deadline is a fatal error--sometimes literally. Very important
commercially, but not covered much in this course.

### 1.4.9 Smart Card Operating Systems

Very limited in power (both meanings of the word).

**Remark**: Professor Marsha Berger, the department's director of undergraduate studies personally told me to mention in my classes that last academic year she had to refer 45 students to the dean for problems with academic integrity. As I mentioned before the department is **very** serious about this subject.
