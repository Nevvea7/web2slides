## 1.5 Operating System Concepts

This will be very brief. Much of the rest of the course will consist of
filling in the details.

### 1.5.1 Processes

A _process_ is program in execution. If you run the same program twice, you
have created two processes. For example if you have two programs compiling in
two windows, each instance of the compiler is a separate process.

Often one distinguishes the state or context of a process--its address space
(roughly its memory image), open files, etc.--from the thread of control. If
one has many _threads_ running in the same _task_, the result is a
multithreaded processes.

The OS keeps information about all processes in the **process table**. Indeed,
the OS views the process **as** the entry. This is an example of an active
entity being viewed as a data structure (cf. discrete event simulations), an

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
observation I first encountered in the (out of print) OS textbook by Finkel I
mentioned previously.

The data contained in a process table entry has many uses. For example, it
enables a processes that is currently blocked or suspended to resume execution
in the future.

tree.png)

#### The Process Tree

The set of processes forms a tree via the fork system call. The forker is the
**parent** of the forkee, which is called a **child**. If the system always
blocks the parent until the child finishes, the tree is quite simple, just a
line.

However, in modern OSes, the parent is free to continue executing and in
particular is free to fork again, thereby producing another child. This
produces a process tree as shown on the far right.

A process can send a **signal** to another process to cause the latter to
execute a predefined function (the signal handler). It can be tricky to write

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
a program with a signal handler since the programmer does not know when in the
mainline program the signal handler will be invoked.

Each user is assigned a User IDentification (**UID**) and all processes
created by that user have this UID. A child has the same UID as its parent. It
is sometimes possible to change the UID of a running process. A group of users
can be formed and given a Group IDentification, **GID**. One UID is special
(the **superuser** or **administrator**) and has extra privileges.

Access to files and devices can be limited to a given UID or GID.

#### Deadlocks

A set of processes is _deadlocked_ if each of the processes is blocked by a
process in the set. The automotive equivalent, shown below, is called

gridlock. (The photograph was sent to me by Laurent Laor, a former 2250
student.)

### 1.5.2 Address Spaces

Clearly, each process requires memory, but there are other issues as well. For
example, your linkers (will) produce a load module that assumes the process is
loaded at location 0. The result is that every load module has the same
(virtual) address space. The operating system must ensure that the virtual
addresses of concurrently executing processes are assigned disjoint physical
memory.

For another example note that current operating systems permit _each_ process
to be given _more_ (**virtual**) memory than the _total_ amount of (**real**)
memory on the machine.

---
### 1.5.3 Files

Modern systems have a hierarchy of files. A file system tree.

  * In MSDOS the hierarchy is a forest not a tree. There is no file, or directory that is an ancestor of both a:\ and c:\.
  * In Unix all files are descendants of the root. I suspect this is true of MacOS, which is Unix on the inside.
  * In recent versions of Windows, My Computer looks like the parent of a:\ and c:\, but that is a feature of the UI not the file systems.
  * In Unix the existence of (hard) links weakens the tree to a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
  * Unix also has symbolic links, which when used indiscriminately, permit directed cycles (i.e., the result is not a DAG).
  * Windows has shortcuts, which are somewhat similar to symbolic links.

You can name a file via an **absolute path** starting at the root directory
(or in Windows a root directory) or via a **relative path** starting at the

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
**current working directory**. One consequence is that the OS must know the
current working directory for each process.

In addition to regular files and directories, Unix also uses the file system
namespace for devices (called **special files**), which are typically found in
the /dev directory. That is, in some ways you can treat the device _as_ a
file. In particular some utilities that are normally applied to (ordinary)
files can be applied as well to some special files. For example, when you are
accessing a unix system using a mouse, type the following command  
`cat /dev/mouse`  
and then move the mouse. On my more modern system the command is  
`cat /dev/input/mice`  
You kill the cat (sorry) by typing cntl-C. I tried this on my linux box (using
a text console) and no damage occurred. Your mileage may vary.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
Before a file can be accessed, it is normally **opened** and a file descriptor
obtained. Subsequent I/O system calls (e.g., read and write) use the file
descriptor rather that the file name. This is an optimization that enables the
OS to find the file once and save the information in a file table accessed by
the file descriptor.

Many systems have standard files that are automatically made available to a
process upon startup. These (initial) file descriptors are fixed.

  * standard input: fd=0
  * standard output: fd=1
  * standard error: fd=2

A convenience offered by some command interpreters is a pipe or pipeline. For
example the following command, which pipes the output of dir into a

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
character/word/line counter, will give the number of files in the directory.

    
    
      dir | wc -w

---
### 1.5.4 Input/Output

There are a wide variety of I/O devices that the OS must manage. Some of these
require special treatment; for example, if two processes are printing at the
same time, the OS must _not_ interleave the output.

The OS contains device specific code (drivers) for each device (really each
controller) as well as device-independent I/O code.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
### 1.5.5 Protection

Files and directories have associated permissions.

  * Most systems supply at least rwx (readable, writable, executable).
  * Separate permissions can be defined for the file's owner (files, like processes and users, have UIDs and GIDs), for other users with the same GID as the file, and for everyone else.
  * When a file is opened, permissions are checked and, if the open is permitted, a file descriptor is returned that is used for subsequent operations.
  * A more general mechanism is to provide an **access control list** for each file.
  * Often files have attributes as well. For example the linux ext2 and ext3 file systems support a d attribute that is a hint to the dump program not to backup this file.

Memory assigned to a process, i.e., an address space, must also be protected
so that unrelated processes do not read and write each others' memory.

#### Security

Security has of course sadly become a very serious concern. The topic is quite
deep and I do not feel that the necessarily superficial coverage that time
would permit is useful so we are not covering the topic at all.

### 1.5.6 The Shell (or Command Interpreter)

The shell presents the command line interface to the operating system and
offers several convenient features.

  * Invoke commands.
  * Pass arguments to the commands.
  * Redirect the output of a command to a file or device.
  * Redirect the input of a command to be from a file or device.
  * Pipe one command to another (as illustrated above via dir | wc).

Instead of a shell, one can have a more graphical interface.

### 1.5.7 Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny

Some concepts become obsolete and then reemerge due in both cases to
technology changes. Several examples follow. Perhaps the cycle will repeat
with smart card OS.

#### Large Memories (and Assembly Language)

The use of assembly languages greatly decreases when memories get larger. When
minicomputers and microcomputers (early PCs) were first introduced, they each
had small memories and for a while assembly language again became popular.

#### Protection Hardware (and Monoprogramming)

Multiprogramming requires protection hardware. Once the hardware becomes
available monoprogramming becomes obsolete. Again when minicomputers and
microcomputers were introduced, they had no such hardware so monoprogramming

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
revived.

#### Disks (and Flat File Systems)

When disks are small, they hold few files and a flat (single directory) file
system is adequate. Once disks get large a hierarchical file system is
necessary. When mini and microcomputer were introduced, they had tiny disks
and the corresponding file systems were flat.

#### Virtual Memory (and Dynamically Linked Libraries)

Virtual memory, discussed in great detail later, permits a single program to
address more memory than present in the computer (the latter is called
physical memory). The ability to dynamically remap address also permits
programs to link to libraries during runtime. Hence, when VM hardware becomes
available, so does dynamic linking.

## 1.6 System Calls

A **System call** is the mechanism by which a user (i.e., a process running in
user mode) directly interfaces with the OS. Some textbooks use the term
_envelope_ for the component of the OS responsible for fielding system calls
and _dispatching_ them to the appropriate component of the OS. On the right is
a picture showing some of the OS components and the external events for which
they are the interface.

Note that the OS serves two masters. The hardware (at the bottom)
_asynchronously_ sends interrupts and the user (at the top) _synchronously_
invokes system calls and generates page faults.

There is an important difference between these two cases.


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
  * When the user issues a system call or generates a page fault, the operating system is not executing. When the operating system last relinquished control, it had the opportunity to prepare itself for processing a system call or a page fault.
  * In contrast at almost any point during execution, an interrupt can transfer control to a given point in the operating system. This means that at (almost) any point during its execution, the OS must be prepared for an immediate transfer to a driver or the scheduler. Since the code being executed just prior to the interrupt might be using variables shared with the drivers and the scheduler, being prepared for this immediate transfer is not always easy.

### 1.6.A Executing a System Call

What happens when a user executes a system call such as read()? We show a
detailed picture below, but at a high level, the following actions occur.

  1. Normal function call (in C, Ada, Python, Java, etc.).
  2. Library routine (probably in C, or similar, language).
  3. Small assembler routine. 
    1. Move arguments to a predefined place (perhaps registers).
    2. Poof (a trap instruction) and then the OS proper runs in supervisor mode.
    3. Fix up result (move it to the correct place).
  4. The library routine returns.

#### A Method Call and the Runtime Stack


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
![sinX](http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/diagrams/sinX.png)

Before considering the read() system call, it might be good to review a
typical call/return sequence for a more familiar method. On the right we see
the assembler-like instructions that would appear when one method invokes
sin(x).

The numbers on the left represent memory locations. As we did in the linker
lab, the machine is word addressable and each instruction occupies one word.
The sin() method is in words 1041-1102 and the caller is from 40-300. We are
interested only in the call itself, which occupies 59-61.

The problems we need to solve are first to transfer control from the caller to
the callee passing the value of x and second to transfer control back
returning the calculated value of sin(x).

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

The key data structure is a run-time stack whose changing contents we will
show on the board.

  1. The first instruction (in word 59) pushes the value of x on the stack.
  2. Next we jump to sin() and save the next address (where to save it is system dependent).
  3. Now we calculate sin and put the result in register 1 (the assumed protocol for returning a value).
  4. Then we jump to the address previously saved.
  5. We are now back in the caller. The next instruction increments the stack pointer, which effectively removes the value of x from the stack. Note that now, after the call and return, the stack is back the condition it had when we began.

#### The read() System Call


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
![syscall](http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/diagrams/syscall.png)

A typical invocation of the (Unix) read system call is:

    
    
      count = read(fd,buffer,nbytes)
    

This invocation reads up to nbytes from the file specified by the file
descriptor fd into the character array buffer. The actual number of bytes read
is returned (it might be less than nbytes if, for example, an end-of-file was
encountered). In more detail, the steps performed are as follows.

  1. Push the third parameter on the stack.
  2. Push the second parameter on the stack.
  3. Push the first parameter on the stack.
  4. Call the library routine, which involves saving the return address and

---
 jumping to the routine.
  5. Machine/OS dependent actions, for example putting the system call number for read in a well defined place, such as a specific register. This requires assembly language.
  6. Trap (a magic instruction) causes control to enter the operating system proper and shifts the computer to privileged mode. Assembly language is again used.
  7. The envelope uses the system call number to access a table of pointers to find the handler for this system call.
  8. The read system call handler processes the request.
  9. Another magic (assembler language) instruction returns to user mode and jumps to the location right after the trap.
  10. The library routine returns (there is more; e.g., the count must be returned).
  11. The stack is popped (ending the function invocation of read).

A major complication is that the system call handler may block. Indeed, the
read system call handler is likely to block. In that case a the operating
system will probably switch to another process. Such process switching is f

We describe very briefly some of the Unix (Posix) system calls. A short
description of the Windows interface is in the book.

To show how the four process management calls enable much of process
management, consider the following highly simplified shell.

    
    

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
      while (true)
         display_prompt()
         read_command(command)
         if (fork() != 0)
            waitpid(...)
         else
            execve(command)
         endif
      endwhile
    

The fork() system call duplicates the process. That is we now have a second
process, which is a child of the process that actually executed the fork().
The parent and child are very, VERY nearly identical. For example they have
the same instructions, they have the same data, and they are both currently
executing the fork() system call.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

But there is a difference!

The fork() system call returns a zero in the child process and returns a
positive integer in the parent. In fact the value returned to the parent is
the PID (process ID) of the child.

Thus, the parent and child execute different branches of the if-then-else in
the code above.

Note that simply removing the waitpid(...) gives background jobs.

### 1.6.2 System Calls for File Management

Most files are accessed sequentially from beginning to end. In this case the
operations performed are  
    open()     \-- possibly creating the file  
    multiple read()s and write()s  
    close()

For non-sequential access, lseek is used to move the File Pointer, which is
the location in the file where the next read or write will take place.

---
### 1.6.3 System Calls for Directory Management

Directories are created and destroyed by mkdir and rmdir. Directories are
changed by the creation, modification, and deletion of files. As mentioned,
open can create files. Files can have several names: link gives another name
to an existing file and unlink removes a name. When the last name is gone (and
the file is no longer open by any process), the file data is destroyed.

In Unix, one file system can be **mounted** on (attached to) another. When
this is done, access to an existing directory on the second filesystem is
temporarily replaced by the entire first file system. Most often the directory
chosen is empty before the mount so no files become (temporarily) invisible.

The top picture shows two file systems; the second row shows the result when

the right hand file system is mounted on /y. In both cases squares represent
directories and circles represent regular files.

This is how a Unix system can enable all files, even those on different
physical disks and using different filesystems, to be descendants of a single
root

## 1.A Addendum on Transfer of Control

The transfer of control between user processes and the operating system kernel
can be quite complicated, especially in the case of blocking system calls,
hardware interrupts, and page faults. Before tackling these issues later, we
begin with the familiar example of a procedure call within a user-mode
process.

An important OS objective is that, even in the more complicated cases of page
faults and blocking system calls requiring device interrupts, simple procedure
call semantics are observed _from a user process viewpoint_. The complexity is
hidden inside the kernel itself, yet another example of the operating system
providing a more abstract, i.e., simpler, virtual machine to the user
processes.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

More details will be added when we study memory management (and know
officially about page faults) and more again when we study I/O (and know
officially about device interrupts).

A number of the points below are far from standardized. Such items as where to
place parameters, which routine saves the registers, exact semantics of trap,
etc, vary as one changes language/compiler/OS. Indeed some of these are
referred to as calling conventions, i.e. their implementation is a matter of
convention rather than logical requirement. The presentation below is, we
hope, reasonable, but must be viewed as a generic description of what could
happen, rather than a real description of what does happen with, say, C
compiled by the Microsoft compiler running on Windows 7.

### 1.A.1 User-mode Procedure Calls

Procedure f calls g(a,b,c) in process P. An example is above where a user
program calls read(fd,buffer,nbytes). Note that both f() and g() are in the
same process P and no action goes outside P. Thus we will not mention the
process again in this description.

#### Actions by f Prior to the Call

  1. Save the registers by pushing them onto the stack  (in some implementations this is done by g instead of by f) .  
  

  2. Push arguments c,b,a onto P's stack.  

Note: Stacks usually grow downward from the top of P's segment, so pushing an
item onto the stack actually involves decrementing the stack pointer, SP.  

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
Note: Some compilers store arguments in registers not on the stack.

#### Executing the Call Itself

  3. Execute METHODJUMP <start-address of g>.  
This (fictitious) instruction saves the program counter PC (a.k.a. the
instruction pointer IP), and jumps to the start address of g.

The value saved is actually the updated program counter, i.e., the location of
the next instruction (the instruction to be executed by f when g returns).

#### Actions by g upon Being Called

  4. Allocate space for g's local variables by suitably decrementing SP.  
  

  5. Start execution from the beginning of the program, referencing the parameters as needed. The execution may involve calling other procedures, possibly including recursive calls to f and/or g.

 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---

#### Actions by g When Returning to f

  6. If g is to return a value, store it in the conventional place.  
  

  7. Undo step 4: Deallocate local variables by incrementing SP.  
  

  8. Undo step 3: Execute RETURN (another fictitious instruction), i.e., pop the stack and set PC to the value popped, which is the return address pushed in step 4.

#### Actions by f upon the Return from g:

  9. (We are now at the instruction in f immediately following the call to g.)  
Undo step 2: Remove the arguments from the stack by incrementing SP.  
  


 _Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_

---
  10. Undo step 1: Restore the registers while popping their values off the stack.  
  

  11. Continue the execution of f, referencing the returned value of g, if any.

#### Properties of (User-Mode) Procedure Calls

  * Predictable (often called synchronous) behavior: The author of f knows where and hence when the call to g will occur. There are no surprises, so it is relatively easy for the programmer to ensure that f is prepared for the transfer of control.
  * LIFO (stack-like) structure of control transfer: we can be sure that control will return to f() when the call to g() exits. The above statement holds even if g() calls h() and then h() calls d(). In fact it even holds if, via recursion, g() calls f().  We are ignoring language features such as throwing and catching exceptions, and the use of unstructured assembly coding. In the latter cases all bets are off.
  * Everything happens entirely in user mode and user space.

### 1.A.2 Kernel-mode procedure calls

We mean one procedure running in kernel mode calling another procedure, which
will also be run in kernel mode. Later, we will discuss switching from user
mode to kernel mode and back.

There is not much difference between the actions taken during a kernel-mode
procedure call and during a user-mode procedure call. The procedures executing
in kernel-mode are permitted to issue privileged instructions, but the
instructions used for transferring control are all unprivileged so there is no
change in that respect.

One difference is that often a different stack is used in kernel mode, but
that simply means that the stack pointer must be set to the kernel stack when

switching from user to kernel mode. But we are not switching modes in this
section; the stack pointer already points to the kernel stack. Often there are
two stack pointers one for kernel mode and one for user mode.

### 1.A.3 The Trap instruction

The trap instruction, like a procedure call, is a synchronous transfer of
control: We can see where, and hence when, it is executed. In this respect,
there are no surprises. Although not surprising, the trap instruction does
have an unusual effect: processor execution is switched from user-mode to
kernel-mode. That is, the trap instruction normally is itself executed in
user-mode (it is naturally an _UN_privileged instruction), but the next
instruction executed (which is _NOT_ the instruction written after the trap)
is executed in kernel-mode.

Process P, running in unprivileged (user) mode, executes a trap. The code
being executed is written in assembler since there are no high level languages
that generate a trap instruction. There is no need to name the function that
is executing. Compare the following example to the explanation of f calls g

given above.

#### Actions by P prior to the trap

  1. Save the registers by pushing them onto the stack.  
  

  2. Store any arguments that are to be passed.  The stack is not normally used to store these arguments since the kernel has a different stack. Often registers are used. 

#### Executing the trap itself

  3. Execute TRAP <trap-number>.  
This instruction switch the processor to kernel (privileged) mode, jumps to a
location in the OS determined by trap-number, and saves the return address.
For example, the processor may be designed so that the next instruction
executed after a trap is at physical address 8 times the trap-number.

The trap-number can be thought of as the name of the code-sequence to which
the processor will jump rather than as an argument to trap.

#### Actions by the OS upon being TRAPped into

  4. Jump to the real code.  
Recall that trap instructions with different trap numbers jump to locations
very close to each other. There is not enough room between them for the real
trap handler. Indeed one can think of the trap as having an extra level of
indirection; it jumps to a location that then jumps to the real start address.
If you learned about writing jump tables in assembler, this is very similar.  
  

  5. Check all arguments passed. The kernel must be paranoid and assume that the authors of the user mode program wear black hats.

  6. Allocate space by decrementing the kernel stack pointer.  
The kernel and user stacks are separate.  
  

  7. Start execution from the jumped-to location.

#### Actions by the OS when returning to user mode

  8. Undo step 6: Deallocate space by incrementing the kernel stack pointer.  
  

  9. Undo step 3: Execute (in assembler) another special instruction, RTI or ReTurn from Interrupt, which returns the processor to user mode and transfers control to the return location saved by the trap. The word interrupt appears because an RTI is also used when the kernel is returning from an interrupt as well as the present case when it is returning from an trap. Actually, an RTI doesn't always go back to user mode. Instead it returns to the

mode before the trap or interrupt.

#### Actions by P upon the return from the OS

  10. We are now in at the instruction right after the trap  
Undo step 1: Restore the registers by popping the stack.  
  

  11. Continue the execution of P, referencing the returned value(s) of the trap, if any.

####  Properties of TRAP/RTI

  * Synchronous behavior: The author of the assembly code in P knows where and hence when the trap will occur. There are no surprises, so it is relatively easy for the programmer to prepare for the transfer of control.
  * Trivial control transfer _when viewed from P_: The next instruction _of P_ that will be executed is the one following the trap. As we shall see later, other processes may execute between P's trap and the next P instruction.

  * Starts and ends in user mode and user space, but executed in kernel mode and kernel space in the middle.

**Note:** A good way to use the material in the addendum is to compare the first case (user-mode f calls user-mode g) to the TRAP/RTI case line by line so that you can see the similarities and differences.
