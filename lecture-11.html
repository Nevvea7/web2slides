  7. I had tried to make lab 2 a little easier and removed () from the inputs. Unfortunately, I didn't removed them from the description of the problem. We will accept the lab either way. For example your lab may accept input-1 as either  
    1   0 1 5 1     or as     1   (0 1 5 1).  
If your lab 2 expects the () please say so in your README.

**Note**: We are doing 6.6 before 6.5 since 6.6 is easier and I believe serves as a good warm-up.

## 6.6: Deadlock Prevention

Attack one of the Coffman/Havender conditions.

---
### 6.6.1 Attacking the Mutual Exclusion Condition

The idea is to use spooling instead of mutual exclusion. Not possible for many
kinds of resources.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
### 6.6.2 Attacking the Hold and Wait Condition

Require each processes to request all resources at the beginning of the run.
This is often called **One Shot**.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
### 6.6.3 Attacking the No Preemption Condition

Normally not possible. That is, some resources are inherently pre-emptable
(e.g., memory). For those, deadlock is not an issue. Other resources are non-
preemptable, such as a robot arm. It is often not possible to find a way to
preempt one of these latter resources. One exception, which we shall not
study, is if the resource (say a CD-ROM drive) can be virtualized (recall
hypervisors).


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
### 6.6.4 Attacking the Circular Wait Condition

Establish a fixed ordering of the resources and require that they be requested
in this order. So if a process holds resources #34 and #54, it can request
only resources #55 and higher.

It is easy to see that a cycle is no longer possible.

**Homework:** 10\. Consider Figure 6-4. Suppose that in step (o) C requested S instead of requesting R. Would this lead to deadlock? Suppose that it requested both S and R.

---
## 6.5: Deadlock Avoidance

Let's see if we can tiptoe through the tulips and avoid deadlock states even
though our system does permit all four of the necessary conditions for
deadlock.

An _optimistic_ resource manager is one that grants every request as soon as
it can. To avoid deadlocks with all four conditions present, the manager must
be smart not optimistic.

### 6.5.1 Resource Trajectories

In this section we assume knowledge of the entire request and release pattern
of the processes _in advance_. Thus we are not presenting a practical
solution. I believe this material is useful as motivation for the more nearly
practical solution that follows, the Banker's Algorithm.

The diagram below depicts two processes H (horizontal) and V (vertical)
executing the programs shown on the right.

We plot progress of each process along an axis. In the example we show, there
are two processes, hence two axes, i.e., planar.

  * <reg code> signifies computation that neither requests nor releases any resources.
  * H first requests the printer; then requests the plotter; then uses both; and finally releases the plotter and then the printer
  * V requests the plotter first and releases the printer first.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * The origin of the graph represents both processes starting.
  * Their combined state is a point on the graph.

The time periods where the printer and plotter are needed by each process are
indicated along the axes and their combined effect is represented by the
colors of the squares.

![trajectories](http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/diagrams/trajectorie
s.png)

  * The system starts at the lower left corner and the goal is to reach the upper right corner, where both processes have finished.
  * The dark green is where both processes have the plotter and hence execution cannot reach this area.
  * Light green represents both having the printer; also impossible.
  * Pink represents both processes having both printer and plotter, which is (doubly) impossible.
  * Gold is possible (H has the plotter, V has the printer), but the system can't get there.
  * The cyan is safe. From anywhere in the cyan we have horizontal and vertical moves to the finish point without hitting any impossible area.
  * The brown dot is ... (cymbals) deadlock. We don't want to go there.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * The magenta is very interesting. It is 
    * Possible: each processor has a different resource.
    * Reachable from the starting point.
    * Not deadlocked: each processor can move within the magenta.
    * Deadly: deadlock is unavoidable. The system will hit a magenta-green boundary and then will have no choice but to turn and go to the brown dot.
  * The cyan-magenta border is the danger zone.

The dashed line represents a possible execution pattern.

  * With a uniprocessor no diagonals are possible. We either move to the right meaning H is executing or move up indicating V is executing.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * The trajectory shown represents. 
    1. H excuting a little.
    2. V excuting a little.
    3. H executes; requests the printer; gets it; executes some more.
    4. V executes; requests the plotter.

The crisis is at hand!

  * If the resource manager gives V the plotter, the magenta has been entered and all is lost. Abandon all hope ye who enter here--Dante.
  * The right thing to do is to deny the request, let H execute and move horizontally. While we are under the magenta, we must continue to refuse V even though the plotter is available.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * Once we are under the dark green, we no longer have a choice: The plotter is no longer available so V's request cannot be granted.
  * At the end of the dark green, no danger remains, both processes will complete successfully. Victory!

This procedure is not practical for a general purpose OS since it requires
knowing the programs in advance. That is, the resource manager, knows in
advance what requests each process will make and in what order.

**Homework:** 17\. All the trajectories in the Figure are horizontal or vertical. Under what conditions is is possible for a trajectory to be a diagonal.

**Homework:** 18, 19.

### 6.5.2 Safe States

Avoiding deadlocks given some extra knowledge.

  * Not surprisingly, the resource manager knows how many units of each resource it had to begin with.
  * Also it knows how many units of each resource it has given to each process.
  * It would be great to see all the programs in advance and thus know all future requests, but that is asking for too much.
  * Instead, when each process starts, it announces its maximum usage. That is each process, before making any resource requests, tells the resource manager the maximum number of units of each resource the process can possible need. This is called the **claim** of the process. 
    * If the claim is greater than the total number of units in the system the resource manager kills the process when receiving the claim (or returns an error code so that the process can make a new claim).
    * If during the run the process asks for more than its claim, the process is aborted (or an error code is returned and no resources are allocated).

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
    * If a process claims more than it needs, the result is that the resource manager will be more conservative than need be and there will be more waiting.

**Definition**: A state is **safe** if there is an ordering of the processes such that: if the processes are run in this order, they will all terminate (assuming none exceeds its claim, and assuming each would terminate if all its requests are granted).

Recall the comparison made above between detecting deadlocks with multi-unit
resources and the banker's algorithm).

  * The deadlock detection algorithm makes the most _optimistic_ assumption possible about a running process, namely that the process will return all its resources and then terminate normally. If we still find processes that remain blocked, they are deadlocked.
  * The banker's algorithm will make the most _pessimistic_ assumption about a running process, namely that the process will immediately asks for all the resources it **can** (i.e., up to its initial claim). If, even with such demanding processes, the resource manager can assure that all process terminates, then we can ensure that deadlock is avoided.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
In the definition of a safe state no assumption is made about the running
processes. That is, for a state to be safe, termination must occur no matter
what the processes do (providing each would terminate if run alone and each
never exceeds its claims). Making no assumption on a process's behavior is the
same as making the most pessimistic assumption.

**Remark**: When I say pessimistic I am speaking from the point of view of the resource manager. From the manager's viewpoint, the worst thing a process can do is request resources.

Give an example of each of the following four possibilities. A state that is


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  1. Safe and deadlocked--not possible.
  2. Safe and not deadlocked--a trivial is example is a graph with no arcs.
  3. Not safe and deadlocked--easy (any deadlocked state).
  4. Not safe and not deadlocked--interesting.

not.png)

Is the figure on the right safe or not?

You can **NOT** tell until I give you the initial claims of the process.

For the figure on the right, if the initial claims are:

  * P: 1 unit of R and 2 units of S (written (1,2))
  * Q: 2 units of R and 1 unit of S (written (2,1))

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
the state in the figure is **NOT** safe.

But if the initial claims are instead:

  * P: 2 units of R and 1 units of S (written (2,1))
  * Q: 1 unit of R and 2 units of S (written (1,2))
the state in the figure **IS** safe.

Explain why this is so.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
Please do not make the unfortunately common exam mistake to give an example
involving safe states without giving the claims. So if I ask you to draw a
resource allocation graph that is safe or if I ask you to draw one that is
unsafe, you **MUST** include the initial claims for each process. I often, but
not always, ask such a question and **every** time I have done so, several
students forgot to give the claims and hence lost points.

A manager can determine if a state is safe.

  * Since the manager know all the claims, it can determine the maximum amount of additional resources each process can request.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * The manager knows how many units of each resource it has left.

The manager then follows the following procedure, which is part of **Banker's
Algorithms** discovered by Dijkstra, to determine if the state is safe.

  1. If there are no processes remaining, the state is **safe**.
  2. Seek a process P whose maximum additional request for each resource type is less than what remains for that resource type. 
    * If no such process can be found, then the state is **not safe**.
    * If such a P can be found, the banker (manager) knows that if it refuses all requests except those from P, then it will be able to satisfy all of P's requests.  
**Why?**  

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
**Answer:** Look at how P was chosen.
  3. The banker now pretends that P has terminated (since the banker knows that it can guarantee this will happen). Hence the banker pretends that all of P's currently held resources are returned. This makes the banker richer and hence perhaps a process that was not eligible to be chosen as P previously, can now be chosen.
  4. Repeat these steps.

#### Example 1

Consider the example shown in the table on the right.

A safe state with 22 units of one resource

  * One resource type R with 22 unit.
  * Three processes X, Y, and Z with initial claims 3, 11, and 19 respectively.
  * Currently the processes have 1, 5, and 10 units respectively.
  * Hence the manager currently has 6 units left.
  * Also note that the max additional needs for the processes are 2, 6, and 9 respectively.
  * So the manager cannot assure (with its **current** remaining supply of 6 units) that Z can terminate. But that is **not** the question.

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * This state is safe. 
    1. Use 2 units to satisfy X; now the manager has 7 units.
    2. Use 6 units to satisfy Y; now the manager has 12 units.
    3. Use 9 units to satisfy Z; done!

#### Example 2

This example is a continuation of example 1 in which Z requested 2 units and
the manager (foolishly?) granted the request.

  * Currently the processes have 1, 5, and 12 units respectively.

    1. X is the only process whose maximum additional request can be satisfied at this point.
    2. So use 2 unit to satisfy X; now the manager has 5 units.
    3. Y needs 6 and Z needs 7 and we can't guarantee satisfying either request.
  * Note that we **were** able to find a process (X) that can terminate, but then we were stuck. So it is not enough to find one process. We must find a sequence of all the processes.

**Notes**:

  1. An unsafe state is **not** necessarily a deadlocked state. Indeed, for many unsafe states, if the manager gets lucky all processes will terminate successfully. Processes that are not currently blocked can terminate (instead of requesting more resources up to their initial claim, which is the worst case and is the case the manager prepares for). A safe state means that the manager can **guarantee** that no deadlock will occur (even in the worst case in which processes request as much as permitted by their initial claims.)
  2. When the banker determines that a state is safe, the banker has found an ordering of the processes for which it is guaranteed that all will terminate. There can be other good orderings as well. The banker is **not** committed to the ordering it has found.  
For example, the banker in example 1 found that the order X, Y, Z will

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
guarantee termination. However, if the next event is a request for 1 unit by
Y, the banker will grant that request because the resulting state is again
safe. This is explained further in the next section.

### 6.5.3 The Banker's Algorithm (Dijkstra) for a Single Resource

The algorithm is simple: Stay in safe states. For now, we assume that, before
execution begins, all processes are present and all initial claims have been
given. We will relax these assumptions at the end of the chapter.

In a little more detail the banker's algorithm is as follows.

  * Before execution begins, ensure that the system is safe. That is, check that no process claims more than the manager has. If the check fails, then the offending process is trying to claim more of some resource than exists in the system and hence cannot be guaranteed to complete even if run by itself. You might say that it can become deadlocked all by itself. The only thing the manager can do is to refuse to acknowledge the existence of the offending process.
  * When the manager receives a request, it **pretends** to grant it, and then checks if the resulting state is safe. If it is safe, the request is really granted; if it is not safe the process is blocked (that is, the request is held up).

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
  * When a resource is returned, the manager (politely thanks the process and then) checks to see if the first pending requests can be granted (i.e., if the result would now be safe). If so, the pending request is granted. Whether or not the request was granted, the manager checks to see if the next pending request can be granted, etc.

**Homework:** 21.

### 6.5.4 The Banker's Algorithm for Multiple Resources

At a high level the algorithm is identical to the one for a single resource
type: Stay in safe states.

But what is a safe state in this new setting?

The same definition (if processes are run in a certain order they will all
terminate).


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
Checking for safety is the same idea as above. The difference is that to tell
if there are enough free resources for a processes to terminate, the manager
must check that, for **all** resource types, the number of free units is at
least equal to the max additional need of the process.

**Homework:** Consider a system containing a total of 12 units of resource R and 24 units of resource S managed by the banker's algorithm. There are three processes P1, P2, and P3. P1's claim is 0 units of R and 12 units of S, written (0,12). P2's claim is (8,15). P3's claim is (8,20). Currently P1 has 4 units of S, P2 has 8 units of R, P3 has 8 units of S, and there are no outstanding requests.

  1. What is the largest number of units of S that P1 can request at this point that the banker will grant?
  2. If P2 instead of P1 makes the request, what is the largest number of units of S that the banker will grant?
  3. If P3 instead of P1 or P2 makes the request, what is the largest number of units of S that the banker will grant?

_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---

#### Limitations of the Banker's Algorithm

  * Often users don't know the maximum requests their process will make. They then estimate conservatively (i.e., use big numbers for the claim). This causes the manager becomes very conservative.
  * New processes arriving cause a problem (but not so bad as Tanenbaum suggests). 
    * The process's claim must be less than the total number of units of the resource in the system. If not, the process is not accepted by the manager.
    * Since the state without the new process is safe, so is the state with the new process! Just use the process order the banker had originally and put the new process at the end.
    * Insuring fairness (starvation freedom) needs a little more work, but isn't too hard either (once an hour stop taking new processes until all current processes finish).
  * A resource can become unavailable (e.g., a CD-ROM drive might break). This can result in an unsafe state and deadlock.

**Homework:** 26, 29, and 38. There is an interesting typo in 26. A has claimed 3 units of resource 5, but there are only 2 units in the entire system. Change the problem by having B both claim and be allocated 1 unit of resource 5.

## 6.7 Other Issues

### 6.7.1 Two-phase locking

This is covered extensively in a database text. We will skip it.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
### 6.7.2 Communication Deadlocks

We have mostly considered actually hardware resources such as printers, but
have also considered more abstract resources such as semaphores.

There are other possibilities. For example a server often waits for a client
to make a request. But if the request msg is lost the server is still waiting
for the client and the client is waiting for the server to respond to the
(lost) last request. Each will wait for the other forever, a deadlock.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
A solution to this communication deadlock would be to use a timeout so that
the client eventually determines that the msg was lost and sends another.

But it is not nearly that simple: The msg might have been greatly delayed and
now the server will get two requests, which could be bad, and is likely to
send two replies, which also might be bad.

This gives rise to the serious subject of communication protocols.


_Contents generated from: http://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/courses/os202/class-notes.html_
---
### 6.7.3 Livelock

Instead of blocking when a resource is not available, a process may (wait and
then) try again to obtain it. Now assume process A has the printer, and B the
CD-ROM, and each process wants the other resource as well. A will repeatedly
request the CD-ROM and B will repeatedly request the printer. Neither can ever
succeed since the other process holds the desired resource. Since no process
is blocked, this is not technically deadlock, but a related concept called
_livelock_.

---
### 6.7.4 Starvation

As usual FCFS is a good cure. Often this is done by priority aging and picking
the highest priority process to get the resource. Also can periodically stop
accepting new processes until all old ones get their resources.
